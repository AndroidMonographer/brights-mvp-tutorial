import android.support.test.espresso.IdlingResource;

/**
 * /**
 * The centerpiece of Espresso is its ability to seamlessly synchronize all test operations
 * with the application being tested. By default, Espresso waits for UI events in the current
 * message queue to be handled and for default instances of AsyncTask to complete before it
 * moves on to the next test operation.

 However, there are instances where applications perform background operations, such as
 communicating with web services, using non-standard means, such as direct creation
 and management of threads.

 In such cases, you have to use idling resources to inform Espresso of the appâ€™s
 long-running operations.
